The program is written in the Python language using Spyder (Python 3.6). 
The program creates a model, a simple Agent Based Model (ABM) built on 
a place. Essentially the model is made up of ten randomly located agents 
(picture it as a flock of sheep) which move, and feed a hundred times 
off the environment. The agents are aware of each other and do not 
interfere in the munching of the environment by other agents. Each 
munch is the equivalent of ten units of the environment, thus for 
every move an agent makes, the environment is reduced by ten units.

The model has two variables; agents
