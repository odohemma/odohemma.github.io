      <h2>Veterinary Clinics</h2>
    </p>
	Veterinary professionals carry out their practice in veterinary clinics.
	Veterinary professionals are saddled with administering veterinary 
	treatment. Veterinary medicine deals with the prevention, diagnosis 
	and treatment of disease, disorder and injury in non-human animals. 
	Veterinary professionals monitor and control zoonotic diseases and 
	food safety; maintain food supply through livestock health monitoring 
	and treatment; and maintain mental health of animals (Wikipedia, 2018).
