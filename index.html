About the model:<BR>
The model here is a simple Agent Based Model (ABM) built on an environment 
dataset. Essentially there are ten randomly located agents which move, and 
feed a hundred times off the environment. The agents are aware of each other 
and do not interfere in the 'feeding' process of other agents. Each meal is 
the equivalent of ten units of the environment, thus for every move an agent 
makes, the environment is reduced by ten units. The environment data measures 
300 by 300 (90,000) square units.<BR>
